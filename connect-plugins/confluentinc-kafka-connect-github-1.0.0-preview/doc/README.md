# Introduction

This project provides connector for Kafka Connect to read data from Github.

# Documentation

Documentation on the connector is hosted on Confluent's
[docs site](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-github/).

Source code is located in Confluent's
[docs repo](https://github.com/confluentinc/docs/tree/master/connect/kafka-connect-github). If changes
are made to configuration options for the connector, be sure to generate the RST docs (as described
below) and open a PR against the docs repo to publish those changes!

# Configs
